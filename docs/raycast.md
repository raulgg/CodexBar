# Raycast Provider

[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) Pro, Pro+, and Max plans include a monthly AI credit allowance. Credits launched
with Raycast's September 2026 pricing change: Pro includes 500 credits, Pro+ 3,000, and Max 7,500, with optional
top-ups. The in-app **Settings → Account** card shows remaining credits and the next renewal date.

The desktop app still uses Bearer `GET /api/v1/ai/credits`. CodexBar uses the **website**
session instead:

```text
GET https://www.raycast.com/frontend_api/current_user/ai_credits
Cookie: __raycast_session=…; csrf_token=…
```

## Authentication

Automatic: CodexBar imports the browser session cookie. The session cookie is the host-only `__raycast_session` on
`www.raycast.com` from Account settings. Import uses an exact host match, so other Raycast hosts such as
`backend.raycast.com` are left alone. A parent-domain cookie on `.raycast.com` can still be read, and the account-page
cookie wins when both exist.

Manual: paste that Cookie header into the single **Cookie header** field in Settings. Cookie-only GET is enough; CSRF
is not required for this route. Raycast does not use labeled session-token accounts.

Do not paste the desktop OAuth Bearer. Do not send website cookies to
`backend.raycast.com/api/v1/ai/credits` (401).

## Implementation

The shared plugin cookie broker owns browser import, the cookie cache, and rejection of a session that is missing or
expired. Browser order stays the shared provider catalog, not a Raycast-only importer. The bundled `raycast` plugin
owns the credits GET and snapshot mapping:

1. Resolve a Cookie header that includes a nonempty `__raycast_session` (and optional `csrf_token`).
2. GET `https://www.raycast.com/frontend_api/current_user/ai_credits` with site `Origin` / `Referer` and the resolved
   Cookie header.
3. Map a positive total into one primary Credits meter. The remaining balance is the meter's `resetDescription`. Left and Total rows are kept only when that meter is absent.

## Data shown

| Field | Display |
| --- | --- |
| `remaining_balance_credits`, `total_balance_credits` | One **Credits** meter when the total is above zero. The title keeps the percent (`Credits 67% left`, or `33% used` when usage bars show used). The line under the bar is the remaining balance, `337.38 / 500 credits left`. |
| `next_credits_at` | The meter's standard reset line (`Resets in 25d 4h`, or an absolute `Resets …`). When there is no meter, the same date is the card note `Renews: …`. |
| `funding_subscription.tier` | Header plan label (`pro` → Pro, `pro_plus` → Pro+, `max` → Max) |

When both amounts are present and the total is above zero, the primary meter is percent used of the reported total. The balance string is remaining over that total, so a rollover balance such as `750 / 500 credits left` stays visible and the percent stays at 0% used. Left and Total are not a second Credits section on that card. A zero total leaves the meter off and keeps those rows.

Remaining can exceed the current grant when unused monthly credits roll over. CodexBar still uses the reported total as
the denominator and does not invent extra usage.

Top-up packages and the Show details breakdown (`GET /api/v1/ai/credits/details`) are not fetched yet.

## Limitations

- The website credits route is unofficial and can change without notice.
- Automatic import needs a signed-in www.raycast.com session (`__raycast_session`) in a supported browser.
- BYOK, Bring Your Own Subscription, and local models do not count against these credits and are not shown here.
